# FootballScout+

Welcome to FootballScout+, an android football app for scouting European football clubs and players. 
This app is powered by the [Football-Data.org API](https://www.football-data.org/), providing you with up-to-date information on European football leagues. Currently, the focus is on the English Premier League, with plans to expand to other leagues such as Serie A (Italy), La Liga (Spain), Bundesliga (Germany), and Ligue1 (France) in the future. Additionally, I am currently working on enhancing the bottom navigation experience.
