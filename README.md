Welcome to the European Football Scout App, your go-to platform for scouting European football clubs and players. This project is a work in progress, and we are dedicated to continually improving and expanding its features. Currently, we focus on providing information about clubs and players in the Premier League, with plans to add more leagues such as Serie A, La Liga, Bundesliga, and Ligue 1 in the future. Additionally, we are actively working on enhancing the navigation experience for our users.
